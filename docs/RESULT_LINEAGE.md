# Result lineage

The promoted POLAR result has one evidence chain from the pre-fit data audit to the
portable release. Every selection decision was made on the clean development split.
The official test manifest was opened once, after all final fits and their artifact
hashes had been verified.

## Release chain

## Selection boundary

The following were fixed before the official test cache opened:

- label spaces and primary metric;
- image views, adaptation depths, augmentation, dropout, and fixed epoch counts;
- seeds 42, 52, and 62 for neural fits;
- the DINOv2 multilayer representation and linear/RBF classifier settings;
- seed averaging and the five component ensemble weights;
- bootstrap seed and resample count;
- the external mapping, attribution cohort, and fault-injection levels.

Test results did not affect model identity, weights, or tie-breaking.

## Person-level V-COCO transfer chain - study v2

| Gate | Tracked evidence | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol lock | `results/vcoco_v2/protocol_lock.json` | Model families, views, grouping, and evaluation policy fixed before new fitting |
| Development screen | `results/vcoco_v2/development_candidates.csv` | Candidate comparisons restricted to development data |
| Final selection | `results/vcoco_v2/final_selection_lock.json` | Scale-conditioned stack and all hyperparameters fixed before test access |
| Test-access gate | `results/vcoco_v2/test_access_gate.json` | Official test opened after the selection lock passed |
| Official evaluation | `results/vcoco_v2/official_test_summary.json` | One locked evaluation with paired uncertainty and per-class results |
| Portable export | `results/vcoco_v2/evidence_manifest.json` | Every published v2 table and JSON artifact inventoried by hash |

## Motion-identifiability chain - study v3

| Gate | Tracked evidence | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol and amendment | `results/vcoco_v3/protocol_lineage.json` | Original protocol, CUDA amendment, and source hashes retained in one portable lineage record |
| Human pilot audit | `results/vcoco_v3/annotation_summary.json` | 130 presentations audited; labels excluded from candidate selection |
| Representation and spatial development | `results/vcoco_v3/source_tag_development_metrics.csv` | Frozen representation, crop, and stacking screens completed on source-tag development data |
| Temporal development | `results/vcoco_v3/temporal_development_metrics.csv` | Clip span, temporal model, and routing candidates evaluated before confirmation |
| Grouped temporal cross-fit | `results/vcoco_v3/temporal_crossfit_summary.json` | Student targets and fixed pipeline selected from recording-grouped development evidence |
| Confirmation gate | `results/vcoco_v3/protocol_lineage.json` | Confirmation opened once; confirmation results were not used for selection |
| Sealed confirmation | `results/vcoco_v3/confirmation_summary.json` | Static, temporal, and budgeted-routing results recorded with paired uncertainty |
| Portable export | `results/vcoco_v3/evidence_manifest.json` | Confirmation tables, diagnostics, and protocol lineage inventoried by hash |

## Okutama CPTR development chain

| Gate | Tracked evidence | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol | `experiments/okutama_cptr_protocol.json` | Execution order, CUDA policy, counterfactuals, and promotion thresholds fixed |
| Feature stores | `results/okutama_cptr/provenance.json` | DINOv2 body regions, camera-compensated trajectories, and SigLIP control revision-bound |
| Component screens | `results/okutama_cptr/component_ablation.csv` | Fourteen retained and rejected development steps recorded with their source revisions |
| Five-seed evaluation | `results/okutama_cptr/headline_metrics.csv` | +0.0081 validation macro-F1 for center and parts |
| Grouped cross-fit | `results/okutama_cptr/fold_seed_metrics.csv` | 25 CUDA runs; -0.0020 OOF macro-F1 |
| Faithfulness | `results/okutama_cptr/faithfulness_summary.json` | Temporal null, order, part, geometry, visibility, and latency checks |
| Development lock | `results/okutama_cptr/development_decision.json` | Existing temporal ensemble retained; CPTR calibration left closed |
| Portable export | `results/okutama_cptr/evidence_manifest.json` | Path-sanitized tables and JSON files with per-file hashes |

The CPTR branch ends at its development gate. It does not reuse the previously opened
Okutama confirmation labels, and it does not promote a validation-only gain after the
recording-grouped OOF comparison moves in the opposite direction.

## Local versus tracked artifacts

Local `.runs/` evidence retains checkpoints, fitted classifier binaries, local image
paths, full probability arrays, full-resolution attribution maps, failures, and
interrupted runs. These files are intentionally ignored rather than deleted.

The tracked `results/` export excludes reconstructive or machine-specific artifacts.
Its manifest records the hash of every exported table and JSON document. The final-fit
manifest publishes checkpoint hashes, sizes, configurations, and runtimes without
publishing the checkpoints themselves.

## Historical study

The original 285-image COCO experiment has a separate selection and test lineage. It is
preserved in the non-POLAR result files and summarized in
[`LEGACY_COCO_STUDY.md`](LEGACY_COCO_STUDY.md). Its already-inspected 43-image test set
was not reused to select the POLAR system, and its result is not the repository headline.
